What follows below is a very short introduction to how you can use DGG. For a
slightly longer introduction, see the presentation PDF in the docs folder. A
full report will appear online later.


Installing:
Clone this repository and navigate to the root of the project. To install it,
just type "cabal install".


Using the command-line tool:
Cabal installed the dgg executable in ~/.cabal/bin, which should be in your
PATH. Type "dgg --help" in your favorite shell to get an overview of commands
you can pass to the dgg tool. The adapter and input flags are required.


Using Template Haskell:
To derive code for a particular data type, add the following line to your code:

$(derive deriveEMGM ''Foo)

Where deriveEMGM can (at this point) be replaced by deriveSYB to derive code
for SYB instead. ''Foo is used to specify for which data type you wish to
generate code. Don't forget to enable Template Haskell and import the
appropriate DGG adapter: DGG.Adapter.EMGM or DGG.Adapter.SYB.
